    Backs the opt-in ``confirm_default_good_on_plate_clear`` setting: releasing
    the build plate is the moment the operator moves on to the next job, so an
    unanswered outcome prompt can default to "good part" right there instead of
    lingering as unconfirmed. Only the LATEST pending archive is resolved — the
    plate release refers to the print that just came off the plate, not to
    older unanswered prompts.

    Mirrors the verdict onto the latest PrintLogEntry (the #1444 mirror) and
    retires the one-tap capability token. Deliberately does NOT commit — both
    callers (the clear-plate route and the queue dispatcher) manage their own
    transaction.

    Returns the resolved archive id, or None when nothing was pending.
