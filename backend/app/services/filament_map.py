"""Spread a multi-colour slice across both nozzles of a dual-nozzle printer.

Without a filament map the slicer CLI puts every filament on extruder 1, so a
two-colour job on an H2D or X2D swaps filament at every colour change while
the other nozzle stays cold. Measured on one plate, giving the second colour
to the second nozzle took the print from 2h29m29s / 76.91 g to 1h54m9s /
70.02 g.

The CLI honours ``filament_map`` only from its ``--filament-map`` flag (with
``--filament-map-mode Manual``). The same value in the process profile or the
3MF is written into the output and ignored, and the automatic modes still
answer "1 1" when the second extruder's filament is not declared to them. So
the map is computed here and sent to the sidecar as ``filamentMap``.

The map has to match what is physically loaded, or the print comes out in the
wrong colours. It is therefore derived from the spools the printer reports,
and every doubt returns ``None``, which leaves the slice exactly as it was
before this module existed.
